        Hello! My name is Sashrika Das and welcome to my blog! I am a 9th grade student at East Lyme High School, Connecticut. I have a dog named Sasha that is 7 years old. Along with playing with my dog, Sasha, my favorite hobbies are coding, drawing and sketching, and when the weather is nice, I like to bike, play tennis, and swim as well. I always try to participate in coding competitions and like to share my story with my classmates and teachers.
