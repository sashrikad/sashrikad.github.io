## Garbage Pickup

Usually, there is a certain day for trash pickups in different areas. Let's say the day that there is supposed to be a trash pickup, not a lot of people in the area have much trash in their bin, but there is more trash in other areas where their trash day is some other day. That makes the trash pickup on that day unbeneficial. There needs to be a better way to optimize the pickups to be faster and get to the houses that are more needed of a trash pickup.

Littering is also another concern when it comes to garbage. If the dumpster falls, that can create a big mess really quickly with birds taking the trash and winds blowing it in different directions. But since it is a public dumpster, it is unlikely that someone would bother to pick it up. ðŸš®.

## Trash Route Optimization

Optimizing trash routes involves using some types of distance sensors to measure the level of trash in each can. This data is then processed and used with an algorithm to optimize trash pickup routes, making sure that the fullest cans are taken first. Additionally, accelerometers can be used in a way to detect if a trash can has fallen over. All of this sensor data is stored in a dashboard, providing real-time updates for authorities, allowing for efficient and effective waste management.
